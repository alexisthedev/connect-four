## Info about the project:

This project recreates the popular board game Connect-4 in a command-line interface. It supports multiple consecutive rounds, as winning sequences get turned into asterisks (*) and then disappear!

There is also the ability to save the game at its state and load it up when booting the program, instead of starting a brand new game.

The player that ammases the greater score wins!

## How to run:

0. Download latest python version (or any 3.5.x and upwards)
1. Clone repository
2. Run "py connectfour.py" from your command line from the file's parent directory
3. Play the game with a friend!

## Lessons from working on this project:

4. CSV files and file reading/writing.
5. Improved Python skills.
